    <p id="desc"> <strong>Hello there ! Greetings from the <em>slavic </em> lands ! I am <em>The Northman</em> ! </strong>  I have been called many names as I have been going through a lot of war bloods and dirts.
        However, I have decided that I shall use my hands for the benefits of humanity.<strong> We, as humans, should stop war and help each other  in order to create a better world </strong> ! In my
        website, I have created three recipes that you will like. <strong>Soon, we will cook together and have a big feast ! </strong></p>
