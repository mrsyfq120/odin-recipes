    <p id="desc">Here is a simple but delicious <em>crepe batter</em> which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>


    <p id="ingredients">Ingredients :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Two eggs</li>
        <li>One and a half cup milk</li>
        <li>One and a half cup water</li>
        <li>One and a quarter teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p id="steps">Steps :</p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>

    </ol>
